# E-commerce Sales Analytics Project

This project offers an illustration of data analysis given between 2021 and 2023 on the business operations of an e-commerce platform. The data source can be accessed via this link on the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset.

## File named code.sql is sample code which shows the following details:
* Monthly number of customers, orders and revenue
* Best-seller category each year
* Customer retention cohort in 2023
* RFM analysis

 File dashboard.pbix is a sample dashboard which illustates all of the results gained from the coding.

 ### How to process this project
 * Run the code in PostgreSQL
 * Display the dashboard in Power BI

#### Since it is the first project I have done as a starter, there are several issues which lead to error coding. Please submit an issue using the issues tab above if you would like to propose an improvement to this project.
